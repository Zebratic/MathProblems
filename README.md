# MathProblems
A very simple program that gives you randomised math problems.

## Installation
Simply download the source code and build it using .NET 4.7.2.
Or download the release from [releases](https://github.com/Zebratic/MathProblems/releases).

## Usage
You can use this if you want to calculate some easy-hard math problems.
It supports:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiply
- Division

## Notice
If you use Multiply with 5 digits, it can overflow the Int32 Max value and become negative numbers,
therefor really easy to guess a negative number or a really large one.
